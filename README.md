# Modeling Data

This repo contains 3 distinct lessons.  Complete them at a pace that suits you.

- [Lesson 1: Class Diagrams](class-diagrams.md): Learn to visually represent classes with UML and translate between diagrams and code
- [Lesson 2: Entity Relationship Diagrams](entity-relationship-diagrams.md): Learn how to model data in a database.  This is _super_ similar to Class Diagrams
